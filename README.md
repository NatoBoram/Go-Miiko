Go-Miiko is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot that takes care of [Eldarya](http://www.eldarya.fr/) themed Discord servers. It's written in [Go](https://golang.org/) with the help of [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo). Right now, she only speaks French. As a result, she can only be used in a French server.

You can invite her by clicking [here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=376971915010768896&permissions=268946499&scope=bot). She might come off offline fairly often as I'm working on her and my dedicated server isn't stable.
